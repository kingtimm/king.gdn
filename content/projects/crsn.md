[Baby Name Generator](https://crsn.vercel.app)

Naming a kiddo can be tough. Inspiration can come from name lists, family names, and also suggestions from your friends and family. I built this to help with that process.

## Recommendations
The list on the home page comes from the United State Social Security database. These are randomly selected and paired together with both boy and girl names.

## Creating an account
Using Clerk.Dev for the first time, users can create an account and add a "baby". This baby link allows you to:

- Add name tokens to a pool that give you randomized suggestions (often used for a pool of family names)
- Save and sort favorite first + middle name combinations
- Share a link with your spouse/familiy/friends so that they can also add to your list
